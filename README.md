Project title : STEDI - Human Balance Analytics 

Problem Statement
STEDI has developed a Step Trainer designed to help users improve their balance. This device is equipped with sensors that collect movement data, which is then used to train a machine learning model for accurate step detection. A companion mobile app enhances this functionality by leveraging the phone’s accelerometer to track motion along the X, Y, and Z axes.

With millions of interested customers and several early adopters already using the product, STEDI aims to analyze motion sensor data while ensuring privacy. Only data from consenting users will be included in the machine learning training dataset.

Project Overview
The project involves processing and managing sensor data generated by the Step Trainer and its companion mobile app. The goal is to curate this data into an AWS-based lakehouse solution for data scientists to train machine learning models efficiently.

The data lakehouse is built using:

AWS Glue for data transformation
Amazon S3 for storage
Apache Spark and Python for data processing
The infrastructure is designed with multiple storage zones (Landing, Trusted, and Curated) to facilitate data ingestion, transformation, and querying while handling semi-structured data.

Data Sources
Customer Records – Data from STEDI’s website and order fulfillment systems
Step Trainer Records – Motion sensor data collected from the device
Accelerometer Records – Mobile app data capturing motion in three dimensions
Implementation Approach
Landing Zone – Raw data is collected from various sources and stored in Amazon S3.
Trusted Zone – Data is cleaned, validated, and structured for further processing.
Curated Zone – Fully processed data is optimized and stored for machine learning model training.
This system ensures seamless data flow, privacy compliance, and scalable machine learning capabilities.
